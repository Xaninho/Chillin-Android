## About The Project

:hammer: This project is currently under construction and in its early stages! :wrench:

Chillin is an independent project currently developed by a student, with the scope of creating a convenient Lo-Fi on-line music repository, offering the user access to an online radio and to several playlists placed and verified by the author of the application.

It's built on top of the [UAMP](https://github.com/android/uamp) architecture, which is the most solid way to begin developing an Audio app.

### Built With
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
