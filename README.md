## About The Project

:hammer: This project is currently under development and almost deployed! :wrench:

Chillin' is an independent project currently developed by a student, with the scope of creating a convenient Lo-Fi on-line music repository, offering the user access to an online radio and to several playlists placed and verified by the author of the application.

Future updates and features are going to be developed such as timers, integrated radio, offline play & more.

It's built on top of the [UAMP](https://github.com/android/uamp) architecture, which is the most solid way to begin developing an Audio app.

### Built With
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
